About Me
======

Hi! I'm an Economist by training who enjoys playing with data as a hobby. 

I currently work as a Research Intern at the Council on Energy, Environment and Water in the Clean Air team, working with satellite data to build reproducible early warning systems and evaluate the economic impact of domestic policies on the air quality. 

I've previously worked as a Research Assistant at Indian School of Business, Hyderabad in the Marketing domain. I explored different tools and datasets and data collection methods employing Machine Learning within Marketing and Consumer Behaviour. 

You can get in touch with me using any of the contact options listed on the left pane.

My hobbies include playing the piano (since age 8), painting and doodling (since age 4), making patterns with dominos (since age 24) and making them fall by accident.

Currently
======

On the look out for full-time roles at the intersection of Economics and Data Science applications in industries like Natural Resources, Marketing, Sustainability and Creative Design.

Also wondering about the economic research implications of media generative models on my own time.
