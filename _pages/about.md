About Me
======

Hi! I'm an Economist by training who enjoys playing with data as a hobby. I'm working as a Research Assistant at Indian School of Business, Hyderabad in the Marketing domain. I explore different tools and datasets and data collection methods employing Machine Learning in Marketing. You can get in touch with me using any of the contact options listed on the left pane.

My hobbies include playing the piano (since age 8), painting and doodling (since age 4), making patterns with dominos (since age 24) and making them fall by accident.

Currently
======

On the look out for PhD positions in Quantitative Marketing.
Also low-key wondering about the economic research implications of media generative models.
